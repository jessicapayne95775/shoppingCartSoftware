# Overview

This software was written in an effort to familarize myself with the language of Java. It is simplistic for the reason of just learning the basics and functionality. It was not meant to be a fancy project.

The software is a shopping cart software that allows for adding, removing, and viewing the contents of a cart.

I wrote this software to get a better understanding of how Java works. This was my first Java project and is the first of many that are to come.

# Development Environment

The ide that I used was Visual Studio Code with the JDK extention. While I realize there are probably better ide's to code Java in, my focus was just to get some code written.

The software is in Java and I only used one library for the code: `import java.util.ArrayList;`
